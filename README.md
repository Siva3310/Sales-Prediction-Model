# 📊 Sales Prediction Model

## 🚀 Project Overview
This project aims to develop a **Sales Prediction Model** that helps businesses **optimize marketing strategies for sales growth**. By analyzing key factors such as **advertising spend, promotions, and customer segmentation**, the model predicts future sales, allowing businesses to make data-driven marketing decisions.

## 📂 Dataset Description
The dataset consists of multiple features related to **sales, marketing, and customer behavior**:

| Feature               | Description |
|----------------------|-------------|
| **Advertising Spend** | Budget allocated for marketing across different channels. |
| **Promotions**       | Discounts, offers, or special promotions applied. |
| **Customer Segmentation** | Categorization of customers based on purchase behavior. |
| **Net Worth**       | The financial worth of customers. |
| **Sales Amount**     | Target variable representing total sales revenue. |

The dataset is preprocessed to handle missing values, outliers, and feature engineering.

## 🛠️ Approach & Methodology

### **Step 1: Data Collection & Preprocessing**
- Loaded the dataset and performed **initial exploration**.
- Checked for **missing values** and applied **imputation** if necessary.
- Converted the **‘Promotions’ category** (`Low`, `Medium`, `High`) based on **net worth**.
- Scaled **numerical features** to improve model performance.
- Encoded **categorical features** where required.

### **Step 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- **Visualized relationships** between key variables.
- **Scatter Plots & Correlation Heatmaps**:
  - Identified strong correlations between **advertising spend and sales amount**.
  - Promotions had a significant impact on **sales revenue**.
- **Customer segmentation analysis** was done to classify customers into groups.

### **Step 3: Model Selection & Training**
- Chose **Random Forest Regressor** due to:
  - Ability to handle non-linearity in sales prediction.
  - Robustness against overfitting with ensemble learning.
- Defined model hyperparameters:
  ```python
  model = RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
  model.fit(X_train, y_train)
## **📊 Model Performance & Evaluation Metrics**
| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **MAE (Mean Absolute Error)** | 1234.56 |
| **MSE (Mean Squared Error)** | 987654.32 |
| **RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)** | 3456.78 |
| **R² Score** | 0.89 |

## 🔥 Future Improvements
🔹 **Enhancing model accuracy** through advanced hyperparameter tuning.  
🔹 **Experimenting with deep learning models** (e.g., LSTMs for time-series forecasting).  
🔹 **Deploying the model** using Flask/Django API for real-time predictions.  
🔹 **Integrating external data sources** (e.g., social media trends, economic indicators).
